# Learning Docker

This tutorial is in three parts, and aims to provide an overview of basic Docker concepts. You will build a simple webapp with [Python](http://www.python.org) and [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/), and then extend the webapp to use [Redis](https://www.redis.io) to understand how complex stacks of services interact. 

## Parts 

1. [Orientation and setup](part_1.md)
2. [Containers](part_2.md)
3. Services and Stacks _(coming soon)_
